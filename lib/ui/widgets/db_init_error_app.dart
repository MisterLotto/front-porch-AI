/// it hardcodes a dark bootstrap palette rather than depend on any provider.
///
/// Two variants, because two very different failures land here and the advice
/// for one is useless for the other:
/// - default: the database genuinely couldn't be opened (disk full, no write
///   permission, or another copy of the app holding the file);
/// - [settingsFileCorrupt]: the settings file (`shared_preferences.json`)
///   failed to parse. Startup's first prefs read happens inside the
///   database-open guard, so this used to be misreported as a database
///   failure — users were told to free disk space when the actual fix was
///   removing one damaged file. [PrefsRecovery] heals this automatically;
///   this screen is the fallback for when even that fails.
