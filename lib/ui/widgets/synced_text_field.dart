/// A [TextField] for the common "value in, onChanged out, parent rebuilds"
/// form shape, with the controller OWNED here instead of built in the caller's
/// `build()`.
///
/// Why this exists: a `TextEditingController(text: value)` constructed inline
/// in `build()` is handed to the field fresh on every rebuild, and since the
/// parent rebuilds on every keystroke the caret is thrown away each frame —
/// mid-text editing types into the wrong place and IME composition can never
/// complete. That exact bug was user-reported once already in the Image Studio
/// prompt box; this widget is the fixed pattern, packaged so form sections stop
/// re-deriving it.
///
/// [value] is only pushed into the field when it differs from what the field
/// already holds — i.e. an external rewrite (a preset applied, a value clamped
/// by the caller), never the user's own typing.
