/// Scene Guests (Lite NPCs): every field the feature owns, in one place.
///
/// Persistent guest characters added to a 1:1 scene. They are real library
/// characters that speak in their own bubble via the existing generation
/// engine but carry NO Realism Engine / Needs state (parity-safe). Stored as
/// dbIds inside the session's `groupRealismState` column (always '{}' for
/// plain 1:1 sessions) so no schema change is needed. Group sessions never use
/// these.
///
/// WHY THIS IS A STATE OBJECT AND NOT A SERVICE: the behaviour already lives
/// in `chat_service_scene_guest.dart`, `chat_service_cast.dart` and
/// `chat_service_guest_flow.dart` — parts of the ChatService library that read
/// and write these fields directly. Only the DECLARATIONS moved. Dart parts
/// cannot add fields to a class declared elsewhere, so an extension could
/// never have carried them; a plain holder is the one shape that gets ~150
/// lines out of the shell without changing a single line of logic.
///
/// The public switches `autoChimeEnabled` and `sceneDetectionEnabled` stay on
/// ChatService itself: they are part of its public surface, which
/// `FakeChatService implements ChatService` has to satisfy, and moving public
/// members off the class is exactly the dispatch trap documented in
/// CLAUDE.md's ChatService section.
