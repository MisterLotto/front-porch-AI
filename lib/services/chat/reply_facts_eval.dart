/// The fused reply-facts call — Afterglow's climax check, Pockets & Wardrobe,
/// and the posture pass in ONE post-generation round trip, fired when two or
/// more of them are live for the turn.
///
/// WHY THIS IS NOT THE PIGGYBACKING THE POCKETS RULING FORBIDS (settled
/// 2026-08-07, re-opened by the maintainer 2026-08-10 with the rationale
/// satisfied — see the amendment on [PocketsEval]). That ruling was about one
/// feature riding another FEATURE's pass and silently inheriting its gates:
/// climax rode the needs-impact eval, needs defaults off, so Afterglow was
/// dead on most cards while its row showed green. This call is owned by no
/// feature. The composition rules, each load-bearing:
///
///   * FIRE = OR of the individual gates, and only at two or more. A single
///     live feature keeps firing its own standalone eval, byte-for-byte —
///     nobody's cost or prompt changes until fusion actually saves a call.
///   * PROMPT SECTIONS compose per feature, from the SAME fragment builders
///     the standalone prompts use ([ClimaxEval.rubric],
///     [PocketsEval.wardrobeContext] + [PocketsEval.opsRubric],
///     [TimeService.postureQuestion]) — parity by construction, the
///     RealismPromptBuilder pattern.
///   * SCHEMA `required` is computed per call from the live gates
///     ([kReplyFactsToolsFor]): a model fills in what the schema demands and
///     skips what it does not (the is_climax lesson), so a live feature's
///     fields are demanded and a disabled feature's never are. The field
///     DEFINITIONS are fixed (the converter registry is a fixed contract).
///   * CONSUMPTION is the three features' existing key-scoped parsers
///     ([ClimaxEval.parseRefractory], [PocketsEval.parseOps],
///     [TimeService.parsePosture]) reading the one canonical JSON text —
///     exactly how the one-shot realism eval feeds the relationship,
///     emotional and narrative parsers from one reply. The appliers, chips,
///     swipe/regen rewind and gates do not move.
///
/// FAILURE IS SHARED, AND THAT IS THE ACCEPTED COST: one failed fused call
/// loses all three answers for the turn. Each pass already has a
/// deterministic floor for its own call failing (no cooldown started, record
/// unchanged, stance keeps its last value), so the failure mode is the same
/// shape as today, just correlated. The caller signals it with an EMPTY
/// carrier rather than a null one, so the passes skip instead of paying two
/// or three fallback calls on a backend that just demonstrated it is down.
///
/// Deliberately NOT fused here: the needs-impact eval. It is a judgement call
/// with its own magnitude rubric, strength scaling and Director-authority
/// path — mixing that into three short bookkeeping questions is where small
/// local models start degrading the bookkeeping answers. Fold it in later
/// only behind a capability gate, if at all.
