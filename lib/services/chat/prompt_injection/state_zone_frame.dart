/// The one frame that introduces the STATE ZONE
/// (docs/design/prompt-state-injection.md §6.1) — the recap, the Journal, the
/// objective, the world, and the character-state block, all of which ride the
/// USER turn after the transcript.
///
/// **Why the attribution is words and not a message role.** Every one of those
/// blocks is written by the app, so the obvious fix for "the model thinks the
/// human typed this" was to move them into the system message, where the app's
/// voice is structural. That was tried on 2026-08-08 and REVERTED the same day:
/// the state zone cannot hold a stable prefix, and everything ahead of the
/// transcript must, or a local prefix cache breaks at the first differing byte
/// and re-processes everything after it — which is the whole transcript
/// (measured: 508 vs 5,020 of 5.5k tokens re-prefilled per warm turn, 9.3x the
/// wall clock per reply — full numbers on kStateZoneSectionIds, in
/// chat_service_generation_plan.dart).
///
/// The measurement that settled it was taken on the maintainer's own 200-card
/// diary, replayed against one real chat's 42 recorded emotion values: of 41
/// turn transitions the journal block held its bytes 24 times and changed them
/// 17 — 41% of replies — because the Journal's mood-congruent ordering re-sorts
/// the hot set whenever the emotion FAMILY changes and the 600-token budget
/// then renders a different card set. Across all of that library's real chats
/// it is 543 of 873 transitions. That ordering is a deliberate feature and
/// stays; so the zone stays behind the transcript and pays for attribution in
/// words. This text costs ~121 tokens of prefill a turn on top of a zone that
/// is re-read anyway — keep it tight, and never let it grow into the per-block
/// repetition §1 calls the disease.
///
/// **Why a frame is needed at all.** The recap, the objective step, the world
/// and the character state all assert things in bare present tense, and the
/// first two can legitimately lag the transcript — the recap is rewritten only
/// every `journalInterval` user messages, and objective steps complete in a
/// fire-and-forget background check. Nothing in the prompt ever said which wins
/// when they disagree, so a real model (Kimi 2.6, 2026-08-08) derived the rule
/// itself, out loud, at the cost of its entire reasoning budget — and landed on
/// "the user included a stale recap block by mistake", because from inside the
/// user turn a contradiction it could not resolve looks like a human error.
///
/// **One frame, one register.** The register audit (§1) named repetition and
/// mixed registers as the disease, so the ruling is stated ONCE for the whole
/// zone rather than per block. It splits by KIND rather than by block so it
/// cannot contradict the Journal's own "the feelings here are the truer guide"
/// line: the transcript owns EVENTS (it is the record of what happened), the
/// notes own FEELINGS and inner state (which the transcript never records).
///
/// The scope sentence names the KINDS of note the zone carries, so it never
/// lands on the author-directive blocks (post-history instructions, the
/// Author's Note, the @AN lorebook buckets) that render between the zone's two
/// runs — those genuinely ARE the user's, and attributing them to the app
/// would be a new lie in place of the old one.
///
/// Pronoun policy (§3): pronoun-free except the ungendered "they" — one text
/// serves every character, no gender field.
