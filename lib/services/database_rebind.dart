/// The database to use for a one-off query from the widget tree.
///
/// `Provider<AppDatabase>.value(value: db)` in `main.dart` is a snapshot taken
/// at startup and can never be updated — the provider tree is built inside
/// `runApp`, not inside a State. After a stable-DB import, a storage-root move
/// or a backup restore, [reopenAndRebindDatabase] replaces the singleton, and
/// every widget still reading the provider gets the *closed* database instead.
/// That is exactly how the Database Cleanup dialog, the Data Bank, the
/// character export/transfer sheet and the Stoop upload pages kept throwing
/// "database was closed" until the app was restarted.
///
/// Prefers the live singleton and falls back to the provider, so tests that
/// pump a widget over a provided database (without ever calling
/// `AppDatabase.instance()`) keep working unchanged.

/// the new instance, then reloads the data those services keep in memory.
///
/// Three flows swap the database file underneath a running app: importing a
/// stable DB into a beta build, moving the storage root, and restoring a
/// backup. All three close the live database, which leaves every service
/// holding a handle whose next query throws. Two hand-maintained copies of
/// this rebind already existed (`main.dart` and the storage-path picker) and
/// had already drifted apart — neither ever rebound the RAG [MemoryService] —
/// while the Backups page had no rebind at all and simply told the user to
/// restart. One implementation means a service added here is fixed for every
/// flow at once.
///
/// [cleanOrphanedImages] deletes portrait PNGs that no character references any
/// more. That is safe after an *import*, where the incoming database is the new
/// source of truth. It is **never** safe after a *restore*: an older snapshot
/// legitimately lacks every character created since it was taken, so their
/// portraits would be deleted permanently — the backup can bring the rows back,
/// nothing can bring the art back.
