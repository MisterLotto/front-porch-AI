/// Removes quoted spoken lines from roleplay prose, leaving the narration.
///
/// Front Porch messages follow the usual convention: `*asterisks*` (or bare
/// prose) narrate, `"quotes"` are what a character SAYS. Two very different
/// features need that distinction and used to answer it separately:
///
/// * the image-prompt builder, so a picture never renders the words of a line
///   of dialogue as literal text;
/// * the story clock's OOC time-skip detector, so a character *mentioning* a
///   future date does not move the story to it — see
///   `TimeService.detectOocTimeSkip`, where "will you post a new video next
///   week?" teleported a real chat seven days forward, twice.
///
/// Straight and curly double quotes both count. Single quotes deliberately do
/// NOT: apostrophes are far more common than single-quoted speech, and
/// treating `don't ... can't` as a quoted span would swallow the narration
/// between them.
///
/// An unterminated quote is left alone — the regex needs a closing mark — which
/// is the conservative direction for both callers: unstripped text keeps the
/// old behaviour rather than silently deleting the rest of a message.
